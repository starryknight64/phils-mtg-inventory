Phil's MtG Inventory
===================

MtG Inventory and Deck Builder application

What initially started out as a fun little research project has bloomed into a delightful little Grails program no thanks to the impeccable data provided by mtgjson.com and mtgimage.com

I currently have no intent to serve this on a website somewhere unless enough interest is found.

Otherwise, it's pretty dead-simple to start a Grails app. grails-run and you're good.
